    "# Multilingual Search with Cohere\n",
    "\n",
    "Cohere released what might be the most advanced multilingual embedding model back in December 2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cohere's multilingual model supports **100+** languages and at the time of release provided *230%* better performance than the previous state-of-the-art in multilingual search.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key advance in the ability of this model (beyond pure performance), is the ability to create *meaningful* embeddings for longer text. Previous multilingual models would not produce quality embeddings for anything longer than a sentence of text, Cohere's `multilingual-22-12` model can do it for paragraphs of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by setting up our dataset for multilingual search. The dataset being used is the [Wikipedia multilingual dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikipedia).\n",
